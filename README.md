# Folder-Observer-and-Selenium-Script
Watchdog or any other Folder Observer script which monitors a network or local Folder for Files that are thrown into it.
Mostly .xls Files whose names are saved into Variables and forwarded to a Selenium Script which opens a site and fills out all forms and adds the Files that are being monitored. 
After uploading the Files to the site the Selenium script closes and the Folder Observer script stays running watching for new files.
